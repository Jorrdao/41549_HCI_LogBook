# Low Fidelity Prototype and Evaluation

## D.1. Low Fidelity Prototype

### D.1.1 Low Fidelity Prototype Description
We created a low-fidelity prototype of our application using **Whimsical**, a tool that allowed us to quickly design this prototype. The prototype included the following main pages:

- 🏁 **Race** – list of available and upcoming races
- 📰 **Feed** – posts and relevant community news
- 👤 **Profile** – user profile with past races

### 🔍 User Tasks

We asked users to complete two specific tasks to evaluate the usability and logic of our prototype:

1. **“Go to the Profile page and view the race named *Pernas off*.”**
2. **“Register for an official race.”**

These tasks were designed to test navigation flow, button visibility, and clarity of labels across the prototype.

### 🧠 Observations & Feedback
- Most users were able to complete the tasks without major difficulty.
- One user hesitated before finding the “Pernas off” race, which indicated the need for better visual distinction between past and upcoming races.

## D.2. Prototype Evaluation
The low-fidelity prototype was evaluated through user testing sessions with three participants. Each user was asked to complete two tasks using the Whimsical prototype: (1) locate a past race in the Profile section and (2) register for an official race via the Race page.

### Strengths
Users found the general navigation to be straightforward. The interface structure felt intuitive, especially the clear separation between the "Feed", "Profile", and "Race" sections. The use of icons and consistent layout helped guide users naturally through the screens.

###Thoughts
Although the final interface was not 100% faithful to the low-fidelity prototype, the core concept and user flow remained consistent throughout the design process.
