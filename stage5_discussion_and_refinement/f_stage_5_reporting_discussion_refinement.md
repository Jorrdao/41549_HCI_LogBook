# Refined Prototype

## Refined Prototype

After receiving feedback from users and performing multiple evaluations, we made several improvements to our prototype. These changes focused on enhancing usability, improving layout clarity.

The refined prototype includes:
- A clearer registration process on the "Race" page, with a larger and more prominent sign-up button.
- A simplified "Feed" page, where weekly goals, suggested routes and friend leaderboards are on the side.
- Improved responsiveness of the interactive globe for smoother navigation across devices.
- Enhanced visual contrast and readability across all pages.
- Layout adjustments on the "Profile" page to better highlight upcoming races and user stats.

These refinements have resulted in a more intuitive and visually appealing user experience.
