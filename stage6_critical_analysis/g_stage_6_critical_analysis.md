# Self-Evaluation and Workload

### Self-Evaluation
As a team, we collaborated closely throughout all stages of the project. We began by brainstorming ideas for what was going to be this website name and this project, also defining our user needs, which led to the creation of our low-fidelity prototype using Whimsical. We tested this prototype with users and using their feedback improved our concept of what was going to be YRU Running, user feedback was essential for the development of our high-fidelity prototype, we had some things to improve, but the main issue for us was the design, for this prototype we used react.

We divided responsibilities based on each team memberâ€™s strengths and interests. Some of us focused more on front-end development, while others handled design, user testing, and documentation. We supported each other across all tasks.

We encountered some technical and design challenges during the process, particularly when translating ideas from sketches to code.

### Workload
The workload was balanced across the team. Each member had clear responsibilities, and we rotated roles when needed to share the experience and workload fairly. We met regularly to review our progress and adjust our tasks. Both of us contributed to discussions, prototype refinement, and user evaluations.
